    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (Italian: pasta secca) and fresh (Italian: pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.[5] Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Momos[a] are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan[1] and Nepali cuisine[2] that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan, Bangladesh, and India.[3][4] The majority of Tibetan momos are half-moon in shape like jiaozi, while Nepali momos are normally round like baozi.[5][6] Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines.
